# üóÑÔ∏è backup-action
[GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) for backing up DB & Directories.

First of all, Thanks üôè to @appleboy for [drone-ssh](https://github.com/appleboy/drone-ssh) & [ssh-action](https://github.com/appleboy/ssh-action) to make this happen.

</p>

## Heads up !! Notes
This action backups the things and store it to `/github/workspace/backups` folder inside the container. You can attach several actions available at the [Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) and store this backup to your choice of location.

## Pre Requisites
- SSH Key Access to Remote Server. [How to setup?](#setup-ssh-key)

## Example Usecase
```yaml
name: backup db
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 10 * * 1" # Every Monday at 10 AM UTC
jobs:
  build:
    name: Build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Backup MySQL DB
      uses: valerianpereira/backup-action@master
      with:
        host: ${{ secrets.HOST }}
        username: ${{ secrets.USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.PASSWORD }}
        port: ${{ secrets.PORT }}
        key: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_KEY }}
        type: db
        db_type: mysql
        db_user: ${{ secrets.MYSQL_USER }}
        db_pass: ${{ secrets.MYSQL_PASS }}
        db_port: 3306
        db_name: world
```

output:

```sh

## Setting up SSH Key

Login to Remote Server

Make sure to follow the below steps while creating SSH Keys and using them.
Login with username specified in Github Secrets. Generate a RSA Key-Pair:

 ```bash
 ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
 ```

Add newly generated key into Authorized keys. Read more about authorized keys [here](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/authorized_keys/).

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Copy Private Key content and paste in Github Secrets.

```bash
clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

See the detail information about [SSH login without password](http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html)

## Disclaimer
- Check your keys.
- Check your custom scripts properly.
- Pass all credentials from Github Secrets.
- Pass DB Credentials with Read-only access to database.
- Use it at your own risk! üôè

## Roadmap
- [ ] Add Backup & Restore Commands Explanations to ReadME
- [ ] Features to generate Backup Reports and Store it in txt file.
